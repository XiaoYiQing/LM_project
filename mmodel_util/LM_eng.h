    Construct a real transformation matrix in the context of Loewner Matrix real transform.
    The transformation is based on a target vector of matrices, where sub_blk_size is defined
    as the length each matrix takes from the vector total length.
    The vector of matrices is expected to have the specific pair pattern where each 
    distinct matrix entry is immediately followed by its complex conjugate.
    In this case, the vector total length is found to be:
        total_len = 2*sub_blk_cnt*sub_blk_size.

    The only exception to the above pattern occurs when has_DC_pt = true, in which
    case the very first matrix entry of the vector is purely real. Naturally, it won't
    be followed by a complex conjugate version, so the vector total length would be:
        total_len = ( 2*sub_blk_cnt + 1 )*sub_blk_size.

    > has_DC_pt: If the DC point is present, it means the first sub block vector is real and need
        no complex to real transform.
    > sub_blk_size: The size of each sub-matrix.
    > sub_blk_cnt: The number of distinct sub-matrices, excluding the purely real DC point one, if present.
